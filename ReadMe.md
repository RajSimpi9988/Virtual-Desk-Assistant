# This project is made with the multiple python libraries which help us to implement AI and Advanced Computer Vision.
  The voice assistant uses multiple pytho libraries which are as follows:
      1)pyttsx3
      2)pyjokes
      3)wikipedia
      4)os
      5)webbrowser
      6)speech recognition
      7)date time
   NOTE: the most important library among them on which the others are dependet is "pyttsx3"
   
 # For the Advanced Computer Vision Section of the project there are a lot of diverse functionalities provided by different libraries:
      1) OpenCV
      2) Mediapipe
      3) pyautogui
      4) Tensorflow (Under Development)
